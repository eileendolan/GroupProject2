        <p>There's something amazing about traveling to a foreign place. Not knowing a language fluently or what you will eat in this new place. Sometimes you meet people who open your eyes to knew wonders. Home is where the heart is, but a moment; home is a temporary stay during your travels.</p>

		<p>Although, I enjoy traveling for leisure, my home life consists of working as a mental health counselor and going to school for data analytics. My greatest joy is spending time with my daughter.</p>
